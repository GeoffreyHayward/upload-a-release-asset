# Upload a Release Asset
A demo project of a GitHub Workflow that attaches release assets to a release.

Since [actions/upload-release-asset@v1](https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) has been archived and is stuck on node12 (now deprecated), I have created this demo to show how to do-it-yourself with the GitHub API from within your own workflow.

Hopefully, as still working on it.

Feel free to submit improvements.
